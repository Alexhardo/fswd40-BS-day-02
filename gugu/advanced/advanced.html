         <p>
         Early in the Korean War in 1950, as the North is rolling through South Korea, South Korean Army privates Kang Eun-pyo (Shin Ha-kyun) and Kim Soo-hyeok (Go Soo) are captured during a battle and brought to North Korean captain Jung-yoon. Jung-yoon declares to the prisoners that the war will be over in a week and that he knows exactly why they are fighting this devastating war, before releasing the prisoners, so that they can help reconstruct the nation after the war.	
         </p>
         <p>
         Three years later, in 1953, the war has not ended. Despite ceasefire negotiations, the fighting continues around the Aerok Hills on the eastern front, straddling the 38th Parallel, as that would help determine the future dividing line between the North and the South. The hills change hands constantly and so quickly that even the ceasefire negotiators don't always know who controls them.

         Amidst the fighting, a South Korean officer commanding 'Alligator' Company, fighting at Aerok, is found dead, killed by a Southern bullet. The now-First Lieutenant Eun-Pyo of the South Korean Army's Counterintelligence Corps (the precursor to South Korea's current Defense Security Command) is sent to investigate the murder, and find an apparent mole there who had been mailing letters from Northern troops to into the South.
